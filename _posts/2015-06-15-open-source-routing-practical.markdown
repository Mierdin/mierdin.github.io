Earlier, [I wrote](https://keepingitclassless.net/2015/05/open-source-routing-comparison/) about some interesting open source routing software that I've been exploring lately. In this post, I'll provide you with some tools to get this lab running on your lab, using Vagrant and Ansible.

> In this post, I'll be using VirtualBox, and also Ansible and Vagrant. For this purpose, I'm assuming you're at least somewhat familiar with these tools.

Please checkout my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mierdin/ossrouting) for access to the latest versions of all of the files we'll discuss below - and an easy way to spin all of this up yourself.

# Topology

First, here's the topology we'll be working with.

[![]({{ site.url }}assets/2015/06/oss_routing_lab.png)]({{ site.url }}assets/2015/06/oss_routing_lab.png)

All "circuits" are implemented using VirtualBox host networks, described in the Vagrantfile:

	# -*- mode: ruby -*-

	    end                     
	  end  
	end

# Initial Setup

All configuration files and Ansible playbooks necessary for configuring all three virtual machines are provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mierdin/ossrouting). As you may have seen in the Vagrantfile listed above, all of these playbooks are linked to each virtual machine, so the steps required to clone this repo, and get the lab running are very simple:

	~$ git clone https://github.com/Mierdin/ossrouting.git
	~$ cd ossrouting
	~$ vagrant up

In case you're not familiar with Vagrant, the last step will create and start all virtual machines, as well as provision them using Ansible. If you wish to make changes to any of the files in this repo, you'll have to run "vagrant provision" to push those changes into the VMs once they've been initially provisioned once.

At this point, you should have running VMs that have been configured to run BGP with each other using the software on each. I will now go into detail on how to play with each instance - in order to follow along, you should SSH into each VM using Vagrant. If I'm talking about R1 (Quagga) for instance, you'd type:

	~$ vagrant ssh r1

The specific name wil be listed at the top of each section.

# Quagga (r1)

After provisioning, this virtual machine is actively running zebra and bgpd:

	vagrant@r1:~$ service quagga status
	bgpd zebra

As mentioned in the previous article, Quagga comes with a handy tool called "vtysh" that unifies the configuration for all running daemons under one CLI context, making it feel very similar to something like Cisco IOS.

	vagrant@r1:~$ sudo vtysh

	Hello, this is Quagga (version 0.99.22.4).
	Copyright 1996-2005 Kunihiro Ishiguro, et al.

	r1#

> You may have to press "q" immediately after running vtysh to get to the Quagga CLI

Again - with a certain familiarity, you can display the running configuration, and notice a basic BGP configuration:

	r1# show run
	Building configuration...

	Current configuration:
	!
	[omitted]
	!
	router bgp 111
	 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
	 bgp log-neighbor-changes
	 network 1.1.1.0/24
	 neighbor 192.168.12.12 remote-as 121
	 neighbor 192.168.12.12 next-hop-self
	 neighbor 192.168.12.12 soft-reconfiguration inbound
	 neighbor 192.168.31.13 remote-as 131
	 neighbor 192.168.31.13 next-hop-self
	 neighbor 192.168.31.13 soft-reconfiguration inbound

You can also show the active BGP neighbors, as well as learned prefixes:

	r1# show ip bgp sum
	BGP router identifier 1.1.1.1, local AS number 111
	RIB entries 5, using 560 bytes of memory
	Peers 2, using 9120 bytes of memory

	Neighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd

	192.168.31.13   4   131      43      40        0    0    0 00:34:59        1

	Total number of neighbors 2

	r1# show ip bgp

	BGP table version is 0, local router ID is 1.1.1.1
	Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal,
	              r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed
	Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete

	   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
	*> 1.1.1.0/24       0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i
	*> 2.2.2.0/24       192.168.12.12                          0 121 i
	*> 3.3.3.0/24       192.168.31.13                          0 63000 63000 63000 131 i

Obviously, there are quite a few operational differences between Quagga and the "standard" network operating systems it mimics - if you want to make changes to Quagga configuration, your options are limited to either changing the configuration files behind the scenes and restarting the service(s), or making changes from vtysh. The former option is what I'm doing with Ansible, but this has obvious drawbacks in production.

If you exit out to the shell, you'll notice that Quagga pushes these prefixes into the linux routing table proper:

	vagrant@r1:~$ route
	Kernel IP routing table
	Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
	default         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
	1.1.1.0         *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth3
	2.2.2.0         192.168.12.12   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth1
	3.3.3.0         192.168.31.13   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth2
	10.0.2.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
	192.168.12.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
	192.168.31.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth2

# ExaBGP (r2)

This virtual machine has not been configured to start ExaBGP for us automatically, so we'll need to do that. First, a quick tour. Upon connecting to our ExaBGP instance via SSH, you'll notice there are a few files in ~/exabgp:

	vagrant@r2:~$ cd exabgp
	vagrant@r2:~/exabgp$ ll
	total 20
	drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May 28 03:51 ./
	drwxr-xr-x 6 vagrant vagrant 4096 May 24 21:43 ../
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root     285 May 28 03:51 advroutes.py
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root     289 May 24 08:32 conf.ini
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root     639 May 25 07:06 exabgp.env

"conf.ini" is our configuration file. If you look at this, you'll notice a very basic, two-neighbor configuration:

	vagrant@r2:~/exabgp$ cat conf.ini
	group BGProuters {
	    router-id 2.2.2.2;
	    neighbor 192.168.12.11 {
	        local-address 192.168.12.12;
	        local-as 121;
	        peer-as 111;
	        graceful-restart;
	        process announce-routes {
	            run /usr/bin/python /home/vagrant/exabgp/advroutes.py;
	        }
	    }
	    neighbor 192.168.23.13 {
	        local-address 192.168.23.12;
	        local-as 121;
	        peer-as 131;
	        graceful-restart;
	        process announce-routes {
	            run /usr/bin/python /home/vagrant/exabgp/advroutes.py;
	        }
	    }
	}

You might notice that each neighbor runs a small python script that outputs ExaBGP advertisements to stdout:

{% highlight python linenos %}
vagrant@r2:~/exabgp$ cat advroutes.py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import time

messages = [
'announce route 1.1.1.0/24 next-hop self',
'announce route 2.2.2.0/24 next-hop self',
'announce route 3.3.3.0/24 next-hop self',
]

time.sleep(2)

while messages:
    message = messages.pop(0)
    sys.stdout.write( message + '\n')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(1)

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
{% endhighlight %}

There is also an environment file in this directory that I used to ensure you could recreate the environment with my settings. Let's start ExaBGP using the environment and configuration files in this directory.

	vagrant@r2:~/exabgp$ exabgp --env exabgp.env conf.ini

I won't bother posting the full output here, but the resulting output is fairly self-explanatory. It may take a few extra seconds to connect to our "r3" instance, running BIRD, but it should eventually connect.

# BIRD (r3)

Very similar to Quagga, BIRD should already be running with the correct settings upon connection:

	vagrant@r3:~$ service bird status
	bird start/running, process 4252

The Ansible role for configuring BIRD is fairly simple - I really only needed to overwrite the default configuration file and make sure the BIRD service is started (after installing it of course).

The configuration file is interesting - it seems to allow us to perform some native scripting-esque logic right there in the file:

	vagrant@r3:~$ sudo cat /etc/bird/bird.conf
	router id 33.33.33.33;

	protocol kernel {
	    persist;
	    scan time 20;
	    export all;
	    import all;
	}

	protocol device {
	    scan time 10;
	}

	protocol static {
	}

	protocol direct {
	        interface "eth3";
	}

	filter out_loopback1 {
	    if (net = 3.3.3.0/24) then
	        {
	            bgp_community.empty;
	            bgp_path.prepend(63000);
	            bgp_path.prepend(63000);
	            bgp_path.prepend(63000);
	            accept;
	        }
	    else reject;
	}

	protocol bgp ToQuagga {
	    description "Quagga";
	    debug { states, events };
	    local as 131;
	    neighbor 192.168.31.11 as 111;
	    next hop self;
	    route limit 50000;
	    default bgp_local_pref 300;
	    import all;
	    export filter out_loopback1;
	    source address 192.168.31.13;
	}

	protocol bgp ToExaBGP {
	    description "ExaBGP";
	    debug { states, events };
	    local as 131;
	    neighbor 192.168.23.12 as 121;
	    next hop self;
	    route limit 50000;
	    default bgp_local_pref 300;
	    import all;
	    export filter out_loopback1;
	    source address 192.168.23.13;
	}

I have my familiar two-neighbor configuration, but each refers to an export filter called "out_loopback" which executes a basic conditional statement. If true, I advertise the route (and perform some AS path prepending).

What really sets BIRD apart from the others in my mind is the detached client, "birdc". As mentioned in the previous article, this comes with the BIRD server itself, but it could communicate with the BIRD server through network RPCs, meaning it could be used remotely.

To start it in this environment, just run "sudo birdc" and start poking around:

	vagrant@r3:~$ sudo birdc
	BIRD 1.5.0 ready.
	bird> show status
	BIRD 1.5.0
	Router ID is 33.33.33.33
	Current server time is 2015-06-15 02:07:07
	Last reboot on 2015-06-14 16:29:38
	Last reconfiguration on 2015-06-14 16:29:38
	Daemon is up and running

As you can see, this does seem to dump us into a CLI context of some kind, but it doesn't seem to mimic any other style of CLI:

	bird> ?
	add roa ...                                    Add ROA record
	configure ...                                  Reload configuration
	debug ...                                      Control protocol debugging via BIRD logs
	delete roa ...                                 Delete ROA record
	disable <protocol> | "<pattern>" | all         Disable protocol
	down                                           Shut the daemon down
	dump ...                                       Dump debugging information
	echo ...                                       Control echoing of log messages
	enable <protocol> | "<pattern>" | all          Enable protocol
	eval <expr>                                    Evaluate an expression
	exit                                           Exit the client
	flush roa [table <name>]                       Removes all dynamic ROA records
	help                                           Description of the help system
	mrtdump ...                                    Control protocol debugging via MRTdump files
	quit                                           Quit the client
	reload <protocol> | "<pattern>" | all          Reload protocol
	restart <protocol> | "<pattern>" | all         Restart protocol
	restrict                                       Restrict current CLI session to safe commands
	show ...                                       Show status information

I recommend you poke around these options yourself, there are quite a few useful tools here. However, I would like to briefly mention that there seems to be some interesting configuration safety tools included in the daemon that the client is able to leverage. For instance - checking the validity of a configuration file:

	bird> configure ?
	configure ["<file>"] [timeout [<sec>]]         Reload configuration
	configure check ["<file>"]                     Parse configuration and check its validity
	configure confirm                              Confirm last configuration change - deactivate undo timeout
	configure soft ["<file>"] [timeout [<sec>]]    Reload configuration and ignore changes in filters
	configure timeout [<sec>]                      Reload configuration with undo timeout
	configure undo                                 Undo last configuration change
	bird> configure check "/etc/bird/bird.good"
	Reading configuration from /etc/bird/bird.good
	Configuration OK
	bird> configure check "/etc/bird/bird.bad"
	Reading configuration from /etc/bird/bird.bad
	/etc/bird/bird.bad, line 33: syntax error

This would be hugely useful for automating changes to this configuration file, since we don't have to actually use a configuration file in order to check it (just need to point to it).

Of course, this section would be incomplete without checking on our neighbors. We can plainly see that our two intended BGP neighbor relationships are configured and working well, and we can also see that we've learned the prefixes we wanted to see, with the right number of paths:

	bird> show protocols all ToExaBGP

# Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this lab that I set up to help get your feet wet with open source routing! There's *much* more where this came from - please don't stop here, take this as far as it will let you. There are a lot of options involved that I didn't have space to explore.

Please check out the [Github project](https://github.com/Mierdin/ossrouting) for access to all of the files you'll need to get started. If you are so inclined, and you feel that I am missing a crucial piece of this lab, or maybe I have a typo, feel free to submit a PR!
