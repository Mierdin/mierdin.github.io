I would like to take the opportunity to let you all know that Keeping It Classless will be moving to a different blogging platform in the near future. For the vast majority of you, this will not be a problem. My intent is to keep as much as possible consistent between moves.

However, some of you subscribe to my blog using some WordPress-specific features such as email subscription, as well as following me through the WordPress service itself. After the move, these services will have no way of being updated. If this applies to you, please check out the following options:

I will continue to link to each new blog post to my social media accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. Follow me at whichever you prefer, and you’ll get all new posts in the relevant news feed.
I will continue to provide an RSS feed at https://keepingitclassless.net/feed/. Currently this redirects to feedburner, which is likely what you have in your RSS reader, if you’ve already done this. The transition away from WordPress will break this automatic redirection, but don’t worry – feedburner will continue to deliver post updates to you, at least until I move off of that – which shouldn’t happen for quite some time. One of these days, Google is going to kill that off, so if you want to play it safe, feel free to revisit this feed URL after the transition and update your subscription – the one on my site is going to stick around as long as Keeping It Classless does.
Thank you so much for reading Keeping It Classless the last 4 years or so, and I look forward to the next few years under a new platform!
