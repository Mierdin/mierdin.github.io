About a year and a half ago, arguably well before the biggest of all the SDN hype that we've come to know and love, Stephen Foskett and company organized a fantastic [OpenFlow Symposium](https://keepingitclassless.net/2011/10/review-openflow-symposium-2011-morning-session/) aimed at getting deep into the state of the protocol at that time and what was being done with it at some of the leading tech companies like Google, Yahoo, Cisco, Brocade, and others.

> For those keeping track, Dave Meyer was on the panel at the time representing Cisco but is now CTO and Chief Scientist with Brocade and getting to do some [really cool stuff with OpenDaylight](http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/news/2240183332/Keeping-OpenDaylight-truly-open-QA-with-Brocades-Dave-Meyer).

They're at it again - [a post on SDN News](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/featured/sddc13-videos-slides-download/2013/09/)Â indicates that in September, a similar symposium will be held, but will encompass the entire Software Defined Datacenter, not just networking. Couple that with the fact that vendors have had quite a bit of time to put together SD* strategies (and even products for some), this should make for an excellent event. Per Tech Field Day MO, the day's event will be live streamed over the web.

More details to come, I'm sure, but the page is definitely worth keeping an eye on. Check it out!
