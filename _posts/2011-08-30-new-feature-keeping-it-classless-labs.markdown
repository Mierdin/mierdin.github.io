I'm pleased to announce a new feature on the site. I'm going to start publishing some articles on more fundamental concepts in networking in the form of video walk throughs / labs. I wanted to free up the main blog feed for some more advanced topics, and a lot more of an overall network design discussion, as well as [the occasional fun stuff](https://keepingitclassless.net/2011/08/my-three-favorite-pop-culture-meets-computers-epic-fails/). Several people have approached me in the past about making something like this that would help beginners learn the fundamentals, and at the time I wasn't able to, but I feel like I'm able to do them now. I will be posting videos, documents, and GNS3 labs for you to practice at home with.

These should be similar in content/quality to what you'd see from a video professor such as those found at CBTNuggets, for instance. However, I'm doing this for free. That said, I have no idea how often I'll be able to publish content - I will do my best to publish as steadily as possible, but these things take more time than a normal article, so it may vary.

Having this content on a separate feed will allow me to put it all in one place, and allow those that need it to access it easily. Discussions of these labs can also occur there, as opposed to the main blog feed.

You can access these labs by going to the [KIC Labs category](https://keepingitclassless.net/categories.html#kic labs-ref)!

We'll see how it goes. Let me know what you think!
