<p>Hello there - I'm Matt Oswalt, and the best way I can describe myself is to just fess up to it...I'm a geek. Bordering on "nerd", but doing my best. (Yes, <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nerd-venn-diagram-9420-1252236207-2.jpg" target="_blank">it's an important distinction.</a>) I realized that a technology-oriented field was my destiny when I created my first program - an alien shooter on my TI-82 calculator.</p>

<p>I've held a variety of different roles in my career thus far. My background includes infrastructure consulting, network ops, and software engineering. These days I write code for a living, primarly for the <a href="http://github.com/StackStorm/st2" target="_blank">StackStorm</a> project, as well as various other open source projects you can find on my <a href="http://github.com/mierdin" target="_blank">GitHub profile.</a></p>

<p>Blogging is a big passion of mine - I started Keeping It Classless because my writing is a form of my own learning. When I write about something, there's a pretty good chance that the article was one of my first experiences with the topic. The writing is a way for me to force myself to do the research, generate some useful information, and as an added benefit, share it with the community as a form of giving back. It also helps me, because by participating in this community, I get exposed to a bunch of incredibly smart and helpful folks.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical passions, I also enjoy gaming, making beer, and spending time outdoors in the amazing state of Oregon, USA:</p>

<p>If you want to know more, the majority of my technical work is on my <a href="http://github.com/mierdin" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>, but also consider <a href="http://twitter.com/Mierdin" target="_blank">following me on Twitter</a>. I am super responsive there, and I try to keep my tweets relevant and interesting.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
